CCMenuAdvanced 
==================

CCMenuAdvanced is CCMenu with keyboard support for Mac (esc/arrows/enter), a little bit different alignment options,
and possibility to slide.It should be easy to add CCMenuAdvanced to CCMenu as a patch, not a subclass.
I don't know when i will have time to prepare it for pull request to cocos2d, so feel free to do it instead of me ;)

Main features
-------------
* Selecting and activating CCMenuItems with Keyboard 
(by default next/prev bindings aren't set - set them manually or use one of align methods to bind arrows for this).
* One of CCMenuItems can be set as escapeDelegate - so it will be activated by pressing escape (useful for back/cancel button, this CCMenuItem escapeDelegate can be even child of other CCMenu)
* align left->right, right->left, bottom->top, top->bottom with autosetting self contentSize (useful with relativeAnchorPoint=YES to use menu as sprite, not strange-fullscreen-node)
* externalBoundsRect - if it is set then menu items will be scrollable inside these bounds
* priority property - for mouse and touch - must be set before onEnter to register with new priority

TODO:
-------------
* Rows and columns alignment with automatic contentSize set ( cause i use only vertical/horizontal alignment in iTraceur)
* Other features you need ;)
